## Original Prompt
This website needs a total rewrite:

It is way too lengthy and needs to be broken up into topic-related pages with an easy to use nav bar and excellent navigation.

It needs to be recoded as it was originally written in Adobe Muse which has been discontinued.

It needs to be written in html, css and javascript so new links and items can be easily added later on

It needs to be responsive and mobile friendly

Any images need to be Creative Commons or AI-generated with attribution. Please do not ever use images that might be copyright to someone.

It should have a feel appropriate for churches, Christian non-profits and small Christian businesses as they are our demographic.

If possible give it a multicultural feel as we serve folk from all over the world
